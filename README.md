# express-localtodo
A local Todo app. Built with ExpressJS and pug.

**TODOS:**

*Structure: [TODO] ; [PRIORITY] ; [CURRENT STATUS]*

- [ ] Work on application style -> stylesheets (right now: just plain HTML with a little bit of CSS) ; priority*: **3**
- [ ] Create a more detailed wiki with installing instructions, etc. 
; priority:* **3**

- [x] Implement DB and application testing ; priority*: **0** ; 100% (test cases have to be small tho)


### Even though it is clear, this project is still not finished and probably contains a few bugs and security issues. They will be fixed soon.

### And please keep in mind that I am a ExpressJS newbie. This is my first project.

* Priorities:
*the smaller the number, the more important the task. 0 = urgent!, 3 = will be done soon*
