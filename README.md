# Express-localtodo
A local Todo app. Built with ExpressJS and pug.

### Attention!
Because I've been leading another project that is developed in ExpressJS, I gathered a lot of experience and found lots of room for new features and optimization. I know that this current code is really messy and unstructured (it was my first project in ExpressJS). I will extend and rewrite this application as soon as I have the time! (Don't expect it to happen too soon; I am extremely busy)
