# express-localtodo
A local ToDo app. Built with ExpressJS and pug.

**TODOS:**

*Structure: [TODO] ; [PRIORITY] ; [CURRENT STATUS]*

- [ ] Implement DB and application testing ; priority*: **0** ; 50%
- [ ] Implement working logger ; priority*: **0**
- [ ] General refactoring of core application priority*: **2**
- [ ] Work on application style -> stylesheets (right now: just plain HTML with a little bit of CSS) ; priority*: **3**
- [ ] Implement a password for todos (create a password along with the ToDo-entry -> password is required when trying to update or delete the entry)
; priorit*y: **3**
- [ ] Create a real homepage; a static file that represents the project itself (has nothing to do with functionality) ; priority: **3**
- [ ] Create a more detailed wiki with installing instructions, etc. 
; priority:* **3**
- [ ] (when first version finished) Create docker-compose file for app
; priorit:* **3**
- [ ] Enable picture attachments ; priority*: **optional**


### Even though it is clear, this project is still not finished and probably contains a few bugs and security issues. They will be fixed soon.

### And please keep in mind that I am a ExpressJS newbie. This is my first project.

* Priorities:
*the smaller the number, the more important the task. 0 = urgent!, 3 = will be done soon*
